cat("Friendly remainder from past Avery :)\n 1. Remember to pull from any git repo before making any changes to projects. Merging changes is hell.\n 2. If you finish a file add git then once it's finished commit it with message of what you did. \n 3. Check style guidelines. Even if code is fucntional doesn't mean it's readable. (I care more about my grade then it being alright for me just use standard notation even if it is annoying)\n 4. Add comments before functions. You can do this after you finish the code :)")
